------------------------- My code (logan) - What I changed and why -----------------------

- I replaced my long BIT0..BIT15 ladder with one BIT_HANDLER because it was cleaner and easier        
  to maintain.

- I changed my backspace from the BACK0..BACK15 ladder into one HANDLE_BACKSPACE function.  
  just makes the code far simpler in comparison.

- I updated Clear so it wipes the screen, resets all registers, and resets all input state,   
  not just my local variables. This does slightly update the flowchart, so Clear now restarts  
  everything, not just the bit index. I had a slight issue with the screen not clearing, and I 
  ran into a few bugs where it quit the program instead of just clearing it, but instead it 
  would cancel out a bit after input, and hitting enter again. Very weird bug, so I just 
  reworked it. 

- I added uppercase support for C and Q because the emulator sends capital letters and had to 
  Make sure both inputs work for safety.

- I tied my input loop into Aspen and Kamin’s sections so Enter moves straight into PROCESS.


---------------------------- Kamins - What changed and why ---------------------------------

- Your arrow function " km_output_arrow " was replaced because we needed "-->" for better  
  visual, not "->", and it had to be drawn inside Aspen’s final output routine.

- The sign helper that used R15 for +/– was removed because the project uses real 16-bit  
  signed values, and the sign bit is R0. This slightly changes the flowchart: the sign now   
  comes from MSB, not R15.


---------------------------- Apsen - What changed and why ----------------------------------

- I removed your manual 2’s-complement code (flip bits into IR, add 1, handle carries)  
  because Hack automatically handles negative numbers when you do -valRaw. So for your   
  flowchart, the whole IR step is gone.

- I switched your sign detection from R15 to R0 because R0 is the actual sign bit. update 
  the Flowchart to reflect correct sign source.

- I moved your arrow and sign placement into one final DRAW_RESULT block so output 
  formatting is guaranteed.

---------------------------- Ivan - What changed and why ----------------------------------

- I just reorganized calls so my (Logan’s) input and Aspen’s result printing both use it  
  correctly.

- I used yours/professors " ge_output_g " character to draw the arrow tip >.

- I added a blank-space draw using " ge_output_s " when backspace deletes a bit. Update   
  Flowchart slightly because backspace now affects the screen too.
